                <p class="xl-text overview animated fadeInUpSmall delay-500ms">The blockchain space has been developing exponentially in the last few years. It is definitely a hype in our current world: everyone has heard about it and tech managers, innovation directors, and other trend followers want to use it and apply it to their projects at any cost. </p>
                
                <p class="xl-text overview animated fadeInUpSmall delay-500ms">Speculation that it will be disrupting everything. To have that kind of impact on the everyday lives of people,<span class="highlight"> “blockchain technology needs design more than ever" - IDEO</span>.</p>
                <p class="xl-text overview animated fadeInUpSmall delay-500ms">A processed way of thinking is required which can help people to think about decentralization in a systematic way. As design thinking has supplied us with a plethora of these tools. So one of my objectives is to develop and finetune more and better tools for blockchain thinking, where design thinking meets decentralized thinking.</p>

            <div class="animated fadeInUpSmall delay-750ms">
                <p class="xl-text">Before starting out ideating it’s always better to understand clearly about the problem space and note the opportunity area before jumping to a solution.
                </p>
                <p class="xl-text">Value mapping is a good exercise to identify the problem and opportunity areas. The objective of this simple exercise is to unravel the value chain. How is value being created? Who adds what? Where are you in that process? And where are the friction areas?</p>
               <p class="xl-text">It could go like this:</p>
                 <ul class="large-text">
                        <li>Which contributor/stakeholder does what in the process of creating your product/service? This typically includes contributors outside your own 'company'.</li>
                        <li>What would you call the unit of value (information, money,…)?</li>
                        <li>Find the pain points, with questions like Who is frustrated with whom or what &amp; why? Where do users feel a lack of trust? If you take away one particular step, would you create a trust issue?</li>
                        <li>What are the things users need to know and how can you make them understand better? What are the things that can be hidden from the users? </li>

                </p>
                <p class="xl-text">Once we’ve defined some interesting areas, we can develop How Might We statements around that. This is a proven technique from innovation and design thinking methodologies, enabling everybody to focus on key issues. Sentences like:

            <div class="animated fadeInUpSmall delay-750ms">
                <p class="xl-text">Envision new services, utilities, use cases, and implications. Also finetune the ideation phase and create right question and tiggers.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="xl-text">Design isn’t magically going to solve all of these problems. It takes collaboration between designers and engineers. The solution isn’t 100% driven by design or engineering. The best products exist because design, engineering, and business work together.
                </p>
            <p class="xl-text">This way of thinking about projects, from website design to poster to packaging – can help create designs that are easy to understand and use. And that’s a win for everyone.
